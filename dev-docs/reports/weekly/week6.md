# What worked this week?

- Working on separate branches for each issue made it easier to work in parallel on more than 1 thing. This gave us more freedom and faster turn around on issues 
- After we agreed that PRs need to be reviews within 24 hours, pull requests were reviewed and approved in a very timely manner
- Communication during stand-ups is more streamlined and straightforward
- Got clarification on project expectations. Teammates feel more at ease

# What did not work this week?

- Merge conflict issues because some of us worked simultaneously on the same file (minor)
- Took longer than expected to agree on new DB schema for logs. We think the reason was that we did not vote early during the week and we kept discussing options. We should put a deadline for ourselves and then commit to the solution voted by the team.
